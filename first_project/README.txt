The file assi.py outputs a .npy file containing a very large (~3gb) numpy array that is used by First_Project_Plot.py 
However, git was not allowing me to push that file due to its size. Thus, to run First_Project_Plot.py, assi.py should be run first (uncomment the "save" line at the end and change the path as necessary). However, this file takes many minutes to run and requires specialized packages. As such, I've also uploaded the jupyter notebook of First_Project_Plot as a .html file, where you can see the plots being outputted.
